# Macpaper: Instapaper Application for the Mac

So I've given myself a project as I learn Objective-C and how to develop on the Mac. This project is probably going to stay relatively unsuccessful until, at one point, I'll just nail it and finish it in a week. Most of it has to do with learning OAuth and creating multiple instances of a model, etc.

Plenty to learn. It'll probably be fully coded in a year or so. Check back then.

### Todo:
1. Figure out why NSViews (InstapaperArticles) are black.
2. Figure out how to make the NSWindow scroll to allow all of the NSViews to be seen.
3. Check functionality with going to the sites, etc.
4. Implement OAuth and read in the files.

Plenty to keep me going.
